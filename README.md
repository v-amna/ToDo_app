# ToDo App – Task Management Web Application

## Project Overview

The ToDo App is a simple, responsive task management web application designed to help users organise their daily activities efficiently. The application allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete tasks when no longer required. A dynamic progress bar visually represents the number of completed tasks, encouraging productivity and goal tracking.

This project was developed as part of my web development learning journey using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The focus was on creating a real-life usable application with clear user interaction, accessibility, responsive design, and clean, well-documented code.

## General Project Advice 

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design. I learned how to improve accessibility and usability using semantic HTML and ARIA attributes. In future projects, I plan to focus on advanced JavaScript patterns to further enhance user experience.
