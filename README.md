ToDo App – Task Management Web Application
📌 Project Overview

The ToDo App is a simple, responsive task management web application designed to help users organise their daily activities efficiently. The application allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete tasks when no longer required. A dynamic progress bar visually represents the number of completed tasks, encouraging productivity and goal tracking.

This project was developed as part of my web development learning journey using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The focus was on creating a real-life usable application with clear user interaction, accessibility, responsive design, and clean, well-documented code.
